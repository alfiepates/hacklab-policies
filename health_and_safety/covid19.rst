COVID-19 Policy
===============

This Hacklab policy includes the measures we are actively taking to mitigate the spread of coronavirus and the steps you must follow if you wish to use the Hacklab facilities. 

You are requested to follow all these rules diligently, to ensure a healthy and safe facility for our community. 

This coronavirus (COVID-19) company policy is subject to regular review and changes with the introduction of additional governmental guidelines. If the policy is updated, the directors will update you as soon as possible by email.

This policy is owned by the Edinburgh Hacklab directors. Please email us with any questions or comments.

Background
----------
Edinburgh Hacklab was closed in March 2020 in response to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. We are proud to have responded quickly to protect the health of our community and closed well in advance of the government lockdown. During this time, limited access has been maintained for members to work on essential projects including the production of face shields for the NHS.

With the recent publication of Scottish Government guidance for creative studios (see `https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-creative-studios-and-shared-workspaces/ <https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-creative-studios-and-shared-workspaces/>`_) and a better understanding of transmission vectors, the directors have agreed it is reasonable to reopen to members on a limited basis with enhanced safety precautions.

Scope
-----
This policy applies to all Hacklab users including members, guests, visitors and members of the public. It defines who may use the Hacklab premises and the procedures that must be followed before, during and after your visit to ensure the safety of our community.

Please note that we cannot completely eliminate the risk from coronavirus, however, we are doing all that is reasonably practical to reduce the risk. 

Symptoms of Coronavirus
-----------------------
We must be vigilant against the spread of coronavirus. It is important that all Hacklab users are aware of the symptoms of COVID-19. These are:

- A raised temperature - either you feel hot to touch on your chest or back or a thermometer reads 37.8C or higher
- A continuous cough - coughing a lot for an hour or more than three episodes of coughing in 24 hours
- A loss or change to your sense of smell or taste â€“ you've noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste different to normal

If you are experiencing **any** of the above symptoms then **DO NOT VISIT THE HACKLAB** and consult the NHS for advice

Core Principles
----------------
Our policy is based on the following core principles

- Follow the latest government guidance on opening, prevention and travel
- Follow any requirements imposed by Summerhall
- Risk assess activities
- Advise users to keep their use of premises to essential use where possible and encourage "Hacking at Home"
- Restrict occupancy through the use of a booking system to ensure 2m social distancing at all times
- Introduce regular cleaning and ensure users maintain a clean and tidy facility
- Enforce preventative measures (e.g. hand cleaning, mask use etc)
- Carry out contact tracing should the need arise

COVID-19 Procedures
-------------------
The following procedures apply to all users visiting the Hacklab premises. The following words have special meaning

- **MUST/MUST NOT** - A mandatory rule. Failure to follow these rules will result in a warning. Continued breaches will result in your access to facilities being suspended. These rules protect others from you.
- **SHOULD/SHOULD NOT** - Strong guidance which we advise you to follow unless you have a good reason not to. These rules primarily protect you from others.
- **MAY** - Optional guidance that you might want to consider to reduce risks further.

Who Can Use The Lab?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We are currently only open to members and you **MUST NOT** bring visitors to the Hacklab or allow access to the public. 

We have one exception to this rule where you would otherwise be lone working or require assistance with a project for health and safety reasons (e.g. manual handling). In this case, you **MAY** bring one member of your household (including any bubble) to assist you. If you require this exemption you MUST ensure that the household member has read this policy, completes contact tracing and that you book exclusive use of the room you are working.

For any other exceptions, you **MUST** contact the Hacklab Directors for approval.

How To Book
^^^^^^^^^^^
The Hacklab Booking System is available at `https://booking.ehlab.uk/ <https://booking.ehlab.uk/>`_ and you can login with your normal Hacklab username and password

We have initially set some limits which we will adjust as needed to ensure fairness. If you need to exceed these limits, please email the directors

- You can only book 2 weeks in advance
- You are limited to 10 hours of uncompleted reservations per week. This ensures fair use by preventing large blocks of bookings. After your booking, this limit is reset
- You can only book 50 hours per month in total
- Bookings have a gap between them to reduce exposure risk

We have set a capacity on each room which **MUST** be respected to ensure 2m social distancing

- G1 (Main space) - 2 work areas with access maintained for one person to use the kitchen and shop at any time
- G2 (Laser cutting) - Single occupancy only
- G8 (Workshop) - 2 work areas. Please note in booking if you need any specific machines to help coordinate
- G11 (Storage, 3D printers and servers) - Single occupancy with access to storage area for one additional person. When 3D printing, please don't stay longer than necessary. If you need access to the store, knock first due to limited space.
- G14 (Electronics) - Single occupancy only

All spaces **MUST** be booked with the exception for necessary access to the kitchen, shop or storage.

For G1 and G8 we recognise that members who are at higher risk may require exclusive access to the room. You **MAY** book both areas if this is required although please note that access to the kitchen/shop may be required by other users.
