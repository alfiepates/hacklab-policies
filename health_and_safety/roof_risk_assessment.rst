Risk Assessment for Roof Work
=============================

This is a generic risk assessment which covers the majority of routine work
conducted by Edinburgh Hacklab on the B-Block Flat Roof, primarily the
installation and maintainence of amateur radio antennas and associated
transmission/reception equipment, and for the installation and maintainence of
other projects which may need to be elevated / have a clear view of the sky. 

In this document, the term "Workers" applies to all persons authorised to access
the roof by Edinburgh Hacklab. "Members of the Public" refers to Summerhall
patrons/staff/passers-by in the street not associated with the works being
conducted. 


.. list-table:: Risk Assessment
  :header-rows: 1
  
  * - Hazard
    - Person at Risk
    - Existing Controls in place
    - Further Action / Awareness Required
  * - Access to roof and equipment by unauthorised persons.
    - Members of the Public, Workers, Trespassers
    - Door to roof access is locked, with keys held by Summerhall management. Pole for "Loft Hatch" is stored away from the hatch itself, to prevent opportunistic trespassing.
    -
  * - Fragile Roof/Skylights/Vents
    - Workers, Building Occupants
    - None / None Applicable
    - Those accessing roofs to be made aware of the skylights/vents/other areas of weakness in the roof. 
      The structural integrity of the roof of the building housing the decomissioned Air Handling equipment is not known - no work may be conducted on that roof.
  * - Hazardous emissions from chimneys / fume stacks 
    - Workers
    - Any chimneys / fume stacks are positioned at least 3 meters away from the work areas. Workers are advised not to work within a three meter radius of any fume stacks.
    - If work adjacent to fume stacks is required, a respirator shall be worn. If possible, the equipment connected to the fume stack will be disconnected.
  * - No or limited edge protection
    - Workers, Members of the Public
    - The B-Block roof has a parapet wall representing appropriate edge protection.
    - The roof of the building housing the decomissioned Air Handling equipment has no such edge protection, and no provisions for fall arrest equipment. No work may be conducted there.
  * - Slippery roofs
    - Workers
    - Workers are to wear appropriate footwear when accessing roofs and exercise caution where roofs are wet, icy, or fouled in such a way that they become slippery.
    - None / None Applicable
  * - Lone working
    - Workers
    - Lone working is not permitted.
    - None / None Applicable
  * - Fixed Vertical Ladders ("Jacob's Ladders")
    - Workers
    - Workers to exercise appropriate caution when utilising fixed vertical ladders. Where possible, carrying tools/equipment by hand is to be avoided - ropes/backpacks/tool belt systems are preferred. Only one person is be on the ladder at any one time - Persons below must take care to not be in the area directly below the ladder where unsecured tools may fall.
    - None / None Applicable
  * - Adverse weather
    - Workers, Members of the Public
    - Do not work at height during storms/strong winds.
    - Be particularly mindful of the effect that even light wind can have on antennas / masts which are not properly secured.
  * - Poor/no lighting
    - Workers
    - Workers to carry additional lighting where natural light does not suffice for the work being conducted. Beware of trip hazards presented by extension leads / "Bulldog" floodlights.
    - None / None Applicable
  * - Falling Objects
    - Workers, members of the public
    - Where tools or equipment are being used adjacent to a roof edge and there is a risk of them falling and injuring persons below, those items must be attached to a safety lanyard.
    - For additional safety, consider cordoning off the area below the roof edge to prevent injuries to pedestrians when working near roof edges for extended periods. Good housekeeping throughout the roof work is very important - unsecured tools or equipment should never be left on parapet walls or roof edges
  * - Hot works on roofs
    - Workers
    - No hot work is to be conducted - If hot work is required, a task-specific Risk Assessment and Method Statement (RAMS) will be submitted.
    - None / None Applicable  
  * - Electrical hazards
    - Workers
    - All workers to be aware of equipment that is energised. All work is to be conducted in line with the Health and Safety Executive's "HSG85 Electricity at Work: Safe Working Practices" guideline.
    - None / None Applicable
  * - UV Exposure / Heat
    - Workers
    - Workers to wear appropriate PPE and sun protection cream. Workers to avoid working in direct sunlight for prolonged periods, to take regular breaks, and to keep hydrated with fresh water.
    -
  * - Manual handling
    - Workers
    - Workers to apply "best practice" manual handling techniques.
    - None / None Applicable
  * - Electromagnetic / Radio waves from radiotelecom equipment
    - Workers
    - Workers to apply best practice techniques when working with radio equipment - high-power transmitters are to be disconnected when working on/near high-power radio transmission antennas.
    - None / None Applicable
  * - Head height obstructions
    - Workers
    - Workers to wear appropriate PPE.
    - Some areas of the enclosed air handler loft space have restricted headroom. Workers to maintain awareness of these areas.
  * - Poor "housekeeping"
    - Workers
    - Workers to keep areas tidy and unobstructed, and promptly remove unused materials from the work area once the works are completed.
    - None / None Applicable
  * - Poor communications
    - Workers
    - Workers are to ensure they are able to keep in communication during the work, whether  by unaided voice, loudhailer, or radio communication (dependent on the circumstance). In addition, workers are to carry at least one radio tuned to the Summerhall channel at all times.
    - None / None Applicable
  * - Decomissioned Air Handler Equipment
    - Members of the Public, Workers, Trespassers
